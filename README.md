# NUS-SOC-Summer-Workshop-CUDA-Linear-Programming
This is the project code of a CUDA &amp; Computational Geometric course, during which I implemented an efficient parallel algorithm for solving the 2-D linear programming problem. I have tested the code with the input data of up to 100 million lines and it got the correct answer with really short running time (around 5s).
